            <h3>Brewing Connections Since Day One</h3>
            <br>
            <p>What began as a single store with a passion for exceptional coffee has grown into one of the most recognized and beloved coffeehouses in the world. At Starbucks, we’ve always believed that coffee is more than just a beverage — it’s a bridge between people, cultures, and ideas. Every bean we roast, every cup we serve, and every smile we share is part of our commitment to making a positive difference in the communities we serve.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <br>
            <p>To inspire and nurture the human spirit — one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time. We strive to create a warm and welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and connected.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Our Values</h3>
            <br>
            <p>At Starbucks, we are guided by our core values: integrity, respect, diversity, and excellence. We believe in treating each other with dignity and respect, embracing diversity in all its forms, and striving for excellence in everything we do.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
